# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring a large, monolithic Mongoose models file (models/index.js) that contains all database schemas for the Los Mismos Tours application into separate, organized files. The current file contains 14 different models (User, Profile, Office, Bus, Stop, Route, Trip, SeatHold, Booking, Ticket, PaymentTransaction, Maintenance, AuditLog, Notification) all defined in a single 300+ line file, which makes it difficult to maintain, navigate, and collaborate on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each Mongoose model to be in its own separate file, so that I can easily find, modify, and maintain specific models without navigating through a large monolithic file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look in the models directory THEN I SHALL see separate files for each model (user.model.js, profile.model.js, etc.)
2. WHEN I open any model file THEN it SHALL contain only the schema definition and model export for that specific entity
3. WHEN I import a model THEN it SHALL work exactly the same as before the refactoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean index file that exports all models, so that I can import models using the same syntax as before the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import from the models directory THEN I SHALL be able to use the same import syntax as before
2. WHEN the index file is updated THEN it SHALL automatically export all individual model files
3. WHEN a new model file is added THEN the index file SHALL include it in the exports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file naming and structure across all model files, so that the codebase follows a predictable pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at model files THEN they SHALL follow the naming convention {entity}.model.js
2. WHEN I open any model file THEN it SHALL have the same structure: imports, schema definition, indexes, and model export
3. WHEN I review the code THEN each file SHALL include only the necessary imports and dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the common options and helper utilities to be properly shared, so that there's no code duplication across model files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common options are used THEN they SHALL be imported from a shared utility file
2. WHEN I look at model files THEN there SHALL be no duplicated commonOptions definitions
3. WHEN I update common options THEN it SHALL affect all models that use them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality to work without changes, so that the refactoring doesn't break any existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing imports SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN I run the application THEN all database operations SHALL function identically to before
3. WHEN I run tests THEN they SHALL pass without modification
